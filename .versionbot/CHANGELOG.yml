                From v2.49, the hostapp-update utility creates the /run
                directory in the

                root filesystem, however when huping from previous versions /run
                is not there.


                This commit switches to use /tmp to store the new UUID for the
                root partition on

                first boot after generating new UUIDs.

                rust is used for various utilities in the OS.

                e.g. os-config, healthdog, bindmount, some others maybe


                At the moment, we haven't syncronized on one rust version and
                device

                integration layers can pick any meta-rust version. Which
                probably uses

                the latest rust version in the layer.


                Lets sync on 1.36 and move in steps when needed.

                        This allows a response to an input with dport=`supevisor

                        is required when the host OS is doing stateful
                        firewalling.


                        This should not affect things when stateful firewalling
                        is not in

                        effect, as the standard OUTPUT chain policy is ACCEPT,
                        so we're just

                        being explicit about it.

                        sync-debug.js.


                        We add a command `npm run sync`, which starts a livepush
                        process

                        with the supervisor on a device.

                        This change makes sure we are cycling until a random

                This module is launched at early boot and regenerates filesystem
                UUIDs

                if required.

              hash: b7f63b18bcebf663d4d4d366dc78abe08c15925d
              body: >
                When a partition filesystem label is detected, udev checks
                whether the

                device belongs to the same disk as the root partitition passed
                in the

                kernel command line by the bootloader. Only if it does, it
                creates a by-state

                link to it.


                By using this by-state links we avoid filesystem label clashes
                as the

                system will always use partitions in the same drive as root (as

                instructed by the bootloader who is the source of truth).

                balenaOS uses FAT as a fs type for the boot/first partition.
                This is

                currently hardcoded so let's have the related kernel configs
                built in

                the kernel image. In this way we don't have to handle kernel
                modules in

                the initramfs (when needed).

                process

                so that systemd won't directly kill the user containers first.

                ppp version is 2.4.7. Without defining the right path, the path
                defaults

                to v2.4.5 in NM configure scripts.


                Lets pass it here to keep it correct.


                Should not have any actual affect. NM plugin was built with
                reference

                to the 2.4.7 headers. Just the directoy path would say 2.4.5
                misleading

                some debug effort

                We also delete the patch that switched the 12d1:1f01 modems to
                NCM mode with that specific MessageContent because that made
                other Huawei modems that used the same vid:pid combination
                unusable in that mode. So now these modems will work in the old
                Hilink mode using cdc_ether instead.

                Some devices have special tools in the initramfs that bloat it.

                e.g. Jetson family have tegra-firmware-xusb etc.


                IMAGE_ROOTFS_MAXSIZE triggers an error if the rootfs goes beyond
                this

                limit. This does not force the rootfs to an empty fixed size.


                We can comfortably increase the max size to 32MB to reduce
                unnecessary

                patches in the device integration layers.


                We'll still be covered by the full resin-rootA size limit.

              body: >
                The DNS clients (applications) resolver libraries use the
                timeout value in

                /etc/resolv.conf to set the time between DNS attempts. The
                default is 5

                secs which for slow networks like cellular mean lots of DNS
                requests on

                a bandwidth sensitive channel.


                This change modifies the default to 15 secs. This timeout only
                applies

                when DNS servers are unresponsive so it will not affect the
                normal

                functionality.

            - subject: Increase NTP polling time to around 4.5 hours.
              hash: 4a47b9297b37277a9aece0ea322e706dbe473f12

                This commit increases the default NTP poll rate to around 4.5
                hours.


                BalenaOS uses chronyd for time synchronization, and it allows to
                specify

                a minpoll and maxpoll values per server with a power of two
                number of

                seconds for the minimum and maximum polling time respectively.


                With those constraints, the change set both limits to 2^14s
                (4.55h) for

                all servers.


                An architectural decision has been made not to make this
                configurable.


                Fixes #1780.

                Removed the two patches we included in favor of corresponding
                configure arguments since they had to be updated anyway.

                It is better to use fdisk to check that an internal media
                is a suitable block device rather than using the shell
                internal block testing feature. This is because there is
                at least a case when the kernel lists an ASMT 2115 controller
                as /dev/sda but that is not an actual drive so it cannot be
                written to and the flashing procedure will error out.

                We inherit do_populate_lic_deploy from poky. It uses IMAGE_NAME

                which includes DATETIME


                DATETIME changes between runs so we can sometimes get into a
                state

                where the do_populate_lic_deploy task has its stamp file set.


                But when our subsequent deploy_image_license_manifest task runs,
                the

                DATETIME is different. Hence we get into a state where we have
                to

                run cleanall on the resin-image-flasher recipe to clean up
                directories.


                Lets mark do_populate_lic_deploy with nostamp. This should make
                it

                run every time we need to run deploy_image_license_manifest with
                the

                most up to date DATETIME variable to prevent any hiccups

                Need to make the script go in the background in ExecStartPost=.

                Otherwise, the service status never gets to active/running
                resulting

                it in remaining stuck in an endless loop.


                If the health-check load fails for whatever reason, the
                subsequent

                engine healthcheck will fail retriggering the healthcheck load.

                Customers usually don't need this delay during u-boot. Also in
                some

                cases, hardware attached on the uart pins might pause uboot
                preventing

                customers from using dev images easily.


                But we do need this delay during our development work on bsps
                etc.


                Lets make this autoboot delay build time configurable


                Also make the BOOTDELAY -2 which is better than 0 as that
                completely

                prevents any char on serial from interrupting boot.

                PR #1441 changed mnt-sysroot-inactive to an automount. But there
                is no

                way to easily add a udev dependency to the automount. As a
                result,

                when rollbacks tries to access the inactive partition, it fails.

                Let's add systemd-udev-settle.service to the rollback services.


                This will only delay the first boot after a HUP which is
                reasonable.

      body: >
        Netflix has identified several TCP networking vulnerabilities

        in FreeBSD and Linux kernels. The vulnerabilities specifically

        relate to the Maximum Segment Size (MSS) and TCP

        Selective Acknowledgement (SACK) capabilities.

        The most serious, dubbed SACK Panic, allows a

        remotely-triggered kernel panic on recent Linux kernels.


        These patches address most of these vulnerabilities.

                Our root filesystem is overlayfs or aufs. When latter, the
                system

                crashes when reading a lower directory file. We avoid this by
                always

                falling back to copy and mount (as if overlayfs is not
                available).

                the faster mbim mode and setting mtu=1460 in the modem

                can trigger good reboots. These reboots might be seen by the
                bootloader

                as bad reboots.


                To prevent this from happening, add a service that clears the
                bootcount

                upon good reboots. This only runs if the rollback services have
                not

                cleared their flag files in the state partition.

                Devices using u-boot. Enable rollback-altboot by handling

                U-boot has its own bootcount framework. However, that will
                require

                handling in each device type. We will use u-boot shell commands

                env import -t, env export -t, fatload, fatwrite

                to read/write/increment bootcount in env_resin.h.


                This will allow us to scale to lots of devices.


                A flag os_bootcount_skip is left for devices that are unable to
                support

                fatwrite in u-boot (in some rare cases). This will allow a
                device to

                not support rollback-altboot and still function.


                This patch requires that CMD_SETEXPR be enabled in u-boot config

                options.

                We'd like to enable some options in all boards header files via

                meta-balena. This patch adds a task to include config_resin.h
                into

                config_default.h (which is included in all board header files).

                We can then add a config option via meta-balena that will be
                enabled for

                all devices.


                This patch enables CONFIG_RESET_TO_RETRY. If for whatever
                strange reason

                (accidental fs issue in u-boot etc), this will trigger a u-boot
                reset

                command the device in 15 seconds.


                Note This requires that the device's u-boot supports the reset
                command

                which it probably should.

                or containerd is not functioning correctly.


                Add a healthcheck to spin up a simple hello-world container as
                well.


                The trade-off here is that there will be a few extra writes to
                disk

                every healthcheck timeout. But there will be a benefit that if
                runc

                or containerd is in a bad state, the healthcheck will fail and
                systemd

                Poky, following os-release(5), sanitizes VERSION_ID accordingly
                but in

                doing so it produces a nonisemver compliant version. For
                example:

                    VERSION="2.37.0+rev1"
                    VERSION_ID="2.37.0-rev1"

                This patch reverts that to make sure rev is a build tag.

                This change backports a PR[1] that is already in systemd and
                will come

                included by default from the version in Yocto warrior.


                In summary, with this change we fix newer NM which stopped
                handling

                rp_filter when connected to multiple interfaces. See "device:
                disable

                rp_filter handling" commit from NM. Without this change, only
                the

                default route will me usable and binding to a specific interface
                will

                break connectivity if that interface is not also the default
                route for

                the target IP.

                Currently, bluez's storage data is set to /var/lib/bluetooth
                which

                in turn is a tmpfs location. We want this location persistent so
                we can

                save paired devices over reboot. We do that by adding the
                corresponding

                bind mount to the state partition and setting bluez to depend on
                this

                mount unit.

                VERSION and VERSION_ID had a slightly different semantics in
                balenaOS.

                VERSION was referring to the BalenaOS (host OS) version (which
                is coming from

                device repositories) while VERSION_ID was set to the
                DISTRO_VERSION.

                This brings confusion so we change it to adhere to

                os-config has a dependency on reqwest which broke mdns on 9.6.
                The new

                os-config updated this version to one that restored this
                functionality.

              hash: 157a06ad295a1f03635f8291dfc4dfe3358caa9c
              body: >
                Since 1.29, busybox switched to an internal implementation of
                the

                resolver based on a feature config, NSLOOKUP_BIG. This is
                enabled by

                default and it's meant to be musl compatible. In BalenaOS we use
                glibc

                and we rely on it for being able to resolve names using NSS
                modules

                (libmdns).

                This adds an easier to debug logging that shows both removed and
                kept

                firmwares. For example:

                 Cleaning iwlwifi firmware version 8000C to minimum API version 34.
                   Removing iwlwifi-8000C-13.ucode.
                   Removing iwlwifi-8000C-22.ucode.
                   Removing iwlwifi-8000C-21.ucode.
                   Removing iwlwifi-8000C-31.ucode.
                   Removing iwlwifi-8000C-16.ucode.
                   Removing iwlwifi-8000C-27.ucode.
                   Leaving iwlwifi-8000C-34.ucode in place.
                   Leaving iwlwifi-8000C-36.ucode in place.

                Also, this commit improves the version comparison which was
                comparing

                strings and not integers. Now we try integer comparison and
                fallback to

                string when parse fails.


                Finally, the task's vardeps expands varflags to correctly
                retrigger on

                change.

                This adds set_os_cmdline which defines os_cmdline so that BSPs
                can

                import it in their bootargs and pass it to kernel accordingly.
                Also, as

                part of os_cmdline, there is an argument added when the booted
                image is

                a flasher. This can be used in the OS for various flasher
                specific

                checks.

                Since yocto thud, and more specifically since poky switched to

                openssl 1.1 line, the openssl binary is provided by
                'openssl-bin'. On

                that version, 'openssl' doesn't provide this binary making the

                This patch makes 'openssl-bin' the default dependency but does
                that in a

                way that older yocto versions can overwrite it back to the old
                provider

              hash: b7a6412e6368d3d562ff1ca2fb06be92a24a8548
              body: >
                When we set the udev rule we use IMPORT{program} to know what
                symlinks

                to create in the sysroot directory. The problem is that we don't
                use

                absolute paths and from the documentation udev uses
                /usr/lib/udev as the

                default path while we install the invoked script in /lib/udev.


                ```
                  Execute an external program specified as the assigned value. If no
                  absolute path is given, the program is expected to live in
                  /usr/lib/udev; otherwise, the absolute path must be specified.
                ```


                This PR changes the udev rule to use an absolute path for the

                resin_update_state_probe script. Also it fixes some typos in the
                script

                itself.

                Since thud, poky distro file on which balena OS is based,
                already

                includes security_flags.inc. Because of this change, this
                version throws

                a build warning similar to:


                WARNING Duplicate inclusion for
                /build/../layers/poky/meta/conf/distro/include/security_flags.inc

                in
                /build/../layers/meta-resin/meta-balena-thud/conf/distro/include/balena-os-yocto-version.inc


                This happens because again, we import `poky` and
                `security_flags` but

                since thud, poky includes security_flags by default. In order to
                avoid

                this warning we import it (security_flags) now using an .inc
                file at the

                level of the yocto version meta-balena layer. There is as well a
                small

                additional wrinkle here. We switch the include statement from
                `require`

                to `include` so new layers (like thud) don't have to carry this
                hack in

                the future.


                This commit prepares meta-balena for thud support.

                newer go compiler and also we want to unify it across our
                supported

                yocto versions to avoid eventual possible runtime issues.

                devtool moves the files from the WORKDIR into
                ${S}/oe-local-files which makes

                copying of env_resin.h fail if the u-boot source is being
                modified using

                devtool. Since devtool also alters FILESPATH to include said
                oe-local-files

                directory, we can iterate over those paths instead of relying on
                WORKDIR.

                balenaOS comes in two flavours, production/development.
                production

                images have various options passed to the kernel cmdline.

                Currently some devices BSPs have those options passed and some
                dont.

                It'll be hard to keep the common options consistent.

                e.g. consoleblank=0 is passed for some devices and not for
                others.


                We'd like the extra options we pass to be in one place. All BSPs
                can

                then append this variable in their respective recipe/bootloader
                config

                etc.

                Fix bug where fsck was run on the data partition on every boot

                the

                last filesystem mount timestamp.


                As we run on devices without an rtc, and we run the
                filesystem-expand

                service which runs fsck before ntp sync happens, this results in
                errors

                like


                Superblock last mount time (Thu Mar 14 17:13:02 2019,
                      now = Mon Mar 11 15:29:56 2019) is in the future.
                Fix? yes


                This results in fsck running on the data partition on every boot
                which

                slows down the boot time.


                Add e2fsck.conf file with the broken_system_clock flag to
                prevent this

                check from running fsck on every boot. Quite a few distros do

                Currently mmc and usb devices are checked at every boot for the
                presence

                of flasher images. USB initialization is slow 1-3 seconds. This
                slows

                boot time significantly.


                Most device types dont need to check for the presence of flasher
                images

                in usb devies. Modify u-boot to only check for mmc devices.


                usb initialization happens in devices via the "usb start"
                command. This

                is usually configured in CONFIG_PREBOOT for devices. Devices
                will need

                to remove "usb start" from CONFIG_PREBOOT to benefit from any
                boot time

                optimization.


                We will need to run "usb start" ourselves via env_resin for any

                hexadecimal

                input format"


                We only hit this in the jetson family as the boot partition
                there is

                0xc. Add a simple conversion to hex. This should not affect any
                devices

                that use <9 partition numbers. And allow us to use the same hook

                from meta-balena accross all devices. Currently the jetson
                family has

                its own custom hook with this one-liner.

              hash: 3050840935541c14ded2f9a6a1517d73dfc5ec18
              body: >
                There can be cases where a image type gets invalidated (due to a

                variable change or so) and the dependency of it not. For example
                the img

                type can get invalidated while the hostapp ext3 type doesn't.
                The img

                generatiton script consumes/uses the rootfs generated by the
                hostapp

                type but, it references the artifact based on IMAGE_NAME
                variable which

                includes a time stamp. See bitbake.conf:


                IMAGE_NAME = "${IMAGE_BASENAME}-${MACHINE}-${DATETIME}"


                When that happens, the new timestamp will change and img will
                fail to

                find the old artifact of hostapp. Change this behaviour by using
                the

                symlink reference IMAGE_LINK_NAME which doesn't include a
                timestamp.
